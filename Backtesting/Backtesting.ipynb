    "This notebook describes the Haircut Sharpe Ratios and Profit Hurdle algorithms and how they may be used in real-life applications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms were originally presented by the authors _Campbell R. Harvey_ and _Yan Liu_ in the paper __“Backtesting”__  [available here](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract_id=2345489).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways from the notebook:\n",
    "- Sharpe ratios should be adjusted to data mining and these algorithms provide an analytical way to determine the adjustment magnitude. \n",
    "- These algorithms take into account that the strategies in multiple testing are not independent.\n",
    "- Three methods are available to determine the adjustment. For the financial applications, authors suggest using the BHY method in financial applications.\n",
    "- The haircut is nonlinear and the marginal Sharpe ratios are heavily penalized in comparison to high Sharpe ratios. (In the provided example $61.6\\%$ haircut for $0.78$ Sharpe ratio and only $9.3\\%$ for $0.43$ Sharpe ratio.)\n",
    "- When the number of multiple tests is high, BHY penalizes strategies at a significantly smaller rate compared to Bonferroni and Holm methods. \n",
    "- To use the Haircut Sharpe Ratio algorithm, the following information is required:\n",
    "  - The sampling frequency of the returns\n",
    "  - Number of returns in a sample\n",
    "  - Sharpe ratio observed (annualized or not)\n",
    "  - Autocorrelation coefficient of returns (if Sharpe ratio was not adjusted for the autocorrelation)\n",
    "  - Number of other strategies tested\n",
    "  - Average correlation coefficient of the returns from other strategies\n",
    "- To use the Profit Hurdle algorithm, the following information is required:\n",
    "  - Number of other strategies assumed\n",
    "  - Number of returns in a sample\n",
    "  - Significance level\n",
    "  - Annual volatility of returns\n",
    "  - Average correlation coefficient of the returns from other strategies"
